UPDATED--------PART---------------------------:

Solution (Final) SCENARIO + New Algorithm:

Place the files "lte-rlc-um.cc" & "lte-rlc-um.h" in the following path: "ns-3-dev/src/lte/model"

Place the file dynamicRLCqueue.cc in scratch folder and script parse.py in main ns-3-dev folder

Run Script to generate Graphs and stats
